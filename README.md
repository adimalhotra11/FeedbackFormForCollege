# FeedbackFormForCollege
It is a feedback system where students give their review on their corresponding faculties for all subjects semesterwise.  
These reviews are retrieved, and specific calculations are performed, and a pie-chart is plotted.  
Here student can only review the analytics of the feedbacks that they have given. And the teacher/faculty can review their performance.
